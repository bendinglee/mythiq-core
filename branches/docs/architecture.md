# ðŸ§  Mythiq Architecture

Mythiq operates as a modular AI system designed for cognitive routing and self-description.

## Branch System
- `main.py`: Injects ~40 modules into Flask
- `branches/`: Contains memory, persona, dispatch, reflex, ethics, and more
- `system_introspect/`: Reload, diagnostics, and system bootmap

## Introspection Routes
- `/api/meta/model/snapshot`
- `/api/memory/explore/summary`
- `/api/persona/self`
- `/api/identity/traits`
